# Logistics Company Analysis  
  
## Overview  
This project explores a logistics company's shipping data with two tables: customers and shipments. The goal is to analyze the relationships between customers and their shipments, including shipping methods, weights, and addresses, and to identify operational insights.  
  
## Dataset  
The dataset includes sample records for customers and shipments with fields such as customer name, contact information, package descriptions, weights, and statuses.  
  
## Business Questions  
- Which customers are associated with each shipment?  
- Which shipments exceed a certain weight threshold?  
- What shipments are destined for Texas addresses?  
  
## Skills Demonstrated  
- SQL data definition (CREATE TABLE)  
- Data insertion  
- Joins and filtering  
- Aggregation and ordering  
  
## How to Use  
Run the `Logistics_Company_Analysis.sql` script in an SQL environment to create the tables, insert sample data, and perform analysis queries.
