# Telecommunication Services Analysis  
  
## Overview  
This project analyzes a simplified telecommunications dataset to understand product offerings and customer subscription patterns. The goal is to identify which customers subscribe to specific product types such as cell phone service or internet packages.  
  
## Dataset  
The dataset includes two tables:  
- **products**: Contains product details such as product_id, product_name, product_type (e.g., Internet, Cell Phone Service, TV Package), speed_mbps, data_limit_gb, and monthly_price.  
- **customer_subscriptions**: Contains customer_id, product_id, price, and email for each subscription.  
  
The data is simulated and anonymized for demonstration purposes.  
  
## Business Questions  
- Display sample records from both the products and customer_subscriptions tables to understand the structure.  
- Which customer IDs correspond to customers subscribed to cell phone service products?  
- What are the email addresses of customers subscribed to Internet products?  
  
## Skills Demonstrated  
- SQL table creation and data insertion  
- Basic SELECT queries and filtering  
- Subqueries to identify customers subscribed to specific product types  
  
## How to Use  
Run the `Telecommunication_Services.sql` file in your SQL environment. It will create the necessary tables, insert the sample data, and you can then execute the queries outlined above to answer the business questions.
