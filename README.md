# SQL Portfolio: Business Intelligence and Finance Analytics Work  

Hi, I am Carlos. I am an MBA student focused on Business Intelligence, Finance, and Data Analytics. I enjoy using SQL to clean data, explore patterns, and generate insights that help businesses make smarter decisions.  

This repository highlights a collection of real SQL projects I worked on. Each project includes the business problem, the approach I used, and the insights I found.
